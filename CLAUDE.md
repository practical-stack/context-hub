# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

Context Hub is a **schema definition and reference implementation** repository that establishes standardized approaches for storing contextual knowledge across multiple topic domains, with intelligent selection patterns. The goal is to propose a universal metadata schema and demonstrate its application through concrete examples and logical selection systems.

**This is NOT a library or utility project** - it's about defining storage standards, relationship patterns, and intelligent selection logic.

## Core Mission

### Schema-First Approach with Intelligence
1. **Define Universal Standards**: Create metadata schemas that work across any topic domain
2. **Demonstrate Intelligent Selection**: Show logical patterns for choosing and combining contexts
3. **Establish Relationship Patterns**: Create systematic approaches to context connections
4. **Enable Cross-Domain Consistency**: Same structure and selection logic whether it's prompt engineering, React, or data analysis

### Topic-Domain Demonstration
- **Prompt Engineering** (current): Complete proof-of-concept with intelligent selection system
- **React** (planned): Next domain to demonstrate schema universality and selection adaptation
- **Data Analysis** (planned): Further validation of cross-domain applicability
- **Any Topic** (future): Schema and selection patterns should work for any knowledge domain

### Design Principles

1. **Universal Schema**: Same metadata structure regardless of topic
2. **Rich Semantics**: Detailed contextual headers for human understanding
3. **Intelligent Relationships**: Explicit connections enabling logical selection
4. **Domain Flexibility**: Schema adapts to any subject area
5. **Maintainable Complexity**: Simple enough to manage manually, smart enough to be useful

## Universal Metadata Schema

### Standard Structure (All Domains)

```yaml
---
id: "unique-identifier"                    # kebab-case, unique across domain
title: "Human-Readable Name"               # Clear, descriptive title
description: "Concise explanation"         # 1-2 sentences explaining purpose
category: "domain-specific-category"       # Categorization within domain
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]            # Searchable keywords

contextual_header: |
  Rich semantic description explaining what this context provides,
  in which domain it applies, what specific problems it addresses,
  when it's most effective, what it works well with, and what
  outcomes it produces. This enables human understanding and
  intelligent selection logic.

embedding_metadata:
  domain: "topic-area"                     # e.g., "prompt-engineering", "react"
  technique_type: "domain-specific-type"  # Categorization within domain
  complexity_level: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
  primary_use_cases: ["scenario-1", "scenario-2"]
  solves_problems: ["problem-1", "problem-2"]
  works_well_with: ["context-id-1", "context-id-2"]
  requires_techniques: ["prerequisite-id"]     # Optional: hard dependencies
  conflicts_with: ["incompatible-id"]          # Optional: incompatible contexts
---
```

### Intelligent Selection Framework

The schema enables logical context selection through:

**Relationship-Based Logic:**
```yaml
# Automatic dependency resolution
chain-of-thought:
  requires_techniques: ["prompt-engineering-best-practices"]
  works_well_with: ["xml-tags-structure", "multishot-examples"]

# Conflict prevention
rapid-response-optimization:
  conflicts_with: ["chain-of-thought", "extended-thinking"]
```

**Problem-Solution Matching:**
```yaml
# Direct problem targeting
User Problem: "AI responses are inconsistent"
‚Üí Search: contexts with solves_problems containing "inconsistent"
‚Üí Found: output-consistency, template-based-prompting
‚Üí Selection Logic: [output-consistency, prefilling-responses, template-based-prompting]
```

**Pattern-Based Selection:**
```yaml
# Common proven combinations
Speed-First: [prompt-engineering-best-practices, clear-direct-prompting]
Accuracy-First: [reduce-hallucinations, chain-of-thought, multishot-examples]
Production-First: [template-based-prompting, output-consistency, prefilling-responses]
Creative-First: [system-prompts-roles, clear-direct-prompting, character-consistency]
```

## Intelligent Selection Logic

### Core Selection Patterns

**Diagnostic Questions Approach:**
```yaml
Primary Classification:
- Task Type: Content generation vs. Data analysis vs. Problem solving
- Output Format: Free-form vs. Structured vs. Interactive
- Accuracy Requirements: Creative vs. Balanced vs. Critical

Secondary Specification:
- Complexity: Single-step vs. Multi-step vs. Complex reasoning
- Performance: Speed vs. Quality priority
- Context Scale: Short vs. Long document processing
```

**Selection Matrices:**
```yaml
| Requirements | Primary Context | Secondary Context | Tertiary Context |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Content + Structure + Accuracy | clear-direct-prompting | xml-tags-structure | multishot-examples |
| Analysis + Complex + Accuracy | chain-of-thought | reduce-hallucinations | xml-tags-structure |
| System + Consistency + Repeated | template-based-prompting | output-consistency | prefilling-responses |
```

**Troubleshooting Logic:**
```yaml
Issue Type ‚Üí Diagnosis ‚Üí Solution Path

Inconsistent outputs:
‚Üí Consistency problem
‚Üí Add: output-consistency + template-based-prompting + prefilling-responses

Poor reasoning quality:
‚Üí Reasoning problem  
‚Üí Add: chain-of-thought + xml-tags-structure + multishot-examples

Format violations:
‚Üí Structure problem
‚Üí Add: prefilling-responses + xml-tags-structure + output-consistency
```

## Working with the Schema

### Adding New Domains

1. **Create Domain Directory**: `contexts/{domain-name}/`
2. **Apply Universal Schema**: Use the same metadata structure
3. **Define Domain-Specific Types**: Create `technique_type` categories for the domain
4. **Create Context Modules**: Individual contexts following the schema
5. **Develop Selection Logic**: Adapt diagnostic questions and patterns for the domain
6. **Map Relationships**: Define dependencies, synergies, conflicts

### Schema Compliance for Context Creation

When creating contexts:
- **Follow Standards**: Use `docs/standards/context-metadata-schema.md` exactly
- **Rich Context Headers**: Write detailed semantic descriptions
- **Map Relationships**: Define how contexts connect (`works_well_with`, `requires_techniques`, `conflicts_with`)
- **Domain Consistency**: Use appropriate `technique_type` categories
- **Problem-Solution Clarity**: Clearly define what problems the context solves

### Selection Logic Development

When creating selection systems for new domains:
- **Diagnostic Questions**: Develop domain-specific classification questions
- **Selection Patterns**: Create common combination patterns for typical scenarios
- **Troubleshooting Logic**: Document systematic approaches to resolve issues
- **Relationship Logic**: Use metadata relationships for intelligent suggestions

### Example Domain Expansion

**React Domain** (hypothetical):
```yaml
# react-component-basics.md
domain: "react"
technique_type: "foundational"
works_well_with: ["props-management", "state-basics"]

# state-management-hooks.md  
domain: "react"
technique_type: "state"
requires_techniques: ["react-component-basics"]
conflicts_with: ["class-component-patterns"]

# Selection patterns for React:
Foundation-First: [react-component-basics, props-management]
State-First: [state-management-hooks, component-lifecycle]
Performance-First: [react-memo, virtualization, code-splitting]
```

## Quality Standards

### Current Validation
- Manual schema compliance checking
- Relationship consistency verification (no circular dependencies)
- Cross-reference validation (all referenced IDs exist)
- Selection logic testing with real scenarios

### Scope Limitations
**Intentionally Excluded:**
- Performance metrics and scoring systems
- Automated validation tools
- Complex quality assessments
- Token cost analysis
- Effectiveness rating systems

**Focus**: Simple, maintainable metadata with intelligent selection logic that works across domains
