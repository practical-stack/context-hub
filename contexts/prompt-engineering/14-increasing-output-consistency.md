# Increasing Output Consistency

## Overview

Make Claude's responses more consistent and structured through specific formatting techniques,
prefilling, examples, and retrieval-based grounding.

## Key Techniques

### 1. Specify Exact Output Format

Define desired format using JSON, XML, or custom templates with precise specifications.

**Example - Customer Feedback Analysis**:

```json
{
  "sentiment": "negative",
  "key_issues": [
    "Poor UI/UX in recent update",
    "Difficulty finding basic features",
    "Perceived high pricing"
  ],
  "action_items": [
    {
      "team": "Product",
      "task": "Conduct usability testing and iterate on UI"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Prefill Claude's Response

Start the Assistant turn with your desired format to bypass preambles and enforce structure.

**Example - Sales Report**:

```text
User: Generate today's sales report using this structure...
Assistant (prefill): <report>
    <summary>
        <metric name=
```

This forces Claude to continue in the exact format specified.

### 3. Constrain with Examples

Provide concrete examples of desired output format rather than abstract instructions.

**Example Structure**:

```xml
<competitor>
  <name>Rival Inc</name>
  <overview>A 50-word summary.</overview>
  <swot>
    <strengths>- Bullet points</strengths>
    <weaknesses>- Bullet points</weaknesses>
  </swot>
  <strategy>A 30-word strategic response.</strategy>
</competitor>
```

### 4. Use Retrieval for Contextual Consistency

Ground responses in fixed information sets for tasks requiring consistent context.

**Example - IT Support**:

```xml
<response>
  <kb_entry>1: Reset Active Directory password</kb_entry>
  <answer>To reset your password, go to password.ourcompany.com...</answer>
</response>
```

### 5. Chain Prompts for Complex Tasks

Break down complex tasks into smaller, consistent subtasks where each gets full attention.

## Best Practices

### Format Definition

- Use structured formats (JSON, XML) for machine-readable outputs
- Define every required field explicitly
- Include data types and constraints

### Prefilling Strategy

- Start with opening tags or brackets
- Use for bypassing introductions
- Ensure consistent structure across responses

### Example Usage

- Provide 2-3 diverse examples
- Cover edge cases in examples
- Show exact formatting expected

### Retrieval Integration

- Reference specific knowledge base entries
- Cite sources consistently
- Maintain context across interactions

## Common Use Cases

1. **Data Analysis Reports**: Consistent metrics and insights formatting
2. **Customer Service**: Standardized response structures
3. **Market Intelligence**: Uniform competitor analysis formats
4. **Technical Documentation**: Consistent instruction formatting
5. **Sales Reporting**: Standardized daily/weekly reports

## Pro Tips

- Test output consistency across multiple runs
- Use prefilling for immediate format compliance
- Combine techniques for maximum consistency
- Version control your format specifications
