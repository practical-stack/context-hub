# Contextual metadata for this schema document
contextual_header: |
  This meta-context defines the standardized metadata schema for all Context Hub 
  modules across domains. It specifically addresses context discovery, intelligent 
  composition, and quality assurance by implementing structured semantic metadata 
  and contextual headers. This schema is most effective when applied consistently 
  across all context modules and works as the foundation for automated context 
  selection and composition. It helps solve context discoverability, inconsistent 
  metadata, and poor context relationships, producing a systematic, scalable 
  knowledge management system.

# Context Hub Metadata Schema

This document defines the standardized metadata schema for all Context Hub modules, enabling intelligent discovery, composition, and quality assurance across domains.

## Core Principles

### 1. Semantic Richness
Each context includes a contextual header that provides domain-specific semantic context, explaining the technique's purpose, application domain, and relationships to other techniques.

### 2. Structured Metadata
Systematic metadata enables automated filtering, composition, and quality assessment based on:
- **Functional characteristics** (technique type, complexity, dependencies)
- **Performance metrics** (effectiveness scores, token impact)
- **Relationship mappings** (compatible techniques, prerequisite dependencies)
- **Quality indicators** (validation status, usage patterns)

### 3. Cross-Domain Consistency
The schema applies uniformly across all topic domains while allowing domain-specific extensions.

## Standard Metadata Schema

### Core Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
# Required core metadata
id: "unique-technique-identifier"                    # kebab-case, unique across domain
title: "Human-Readable Technique Name"               # Clear, descriptive title
description: "Concise technique description"         # 1-2 sentences explaining core purpose
category: "domain-specific-category"                 # Primary categorization
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]                      # Searchable keywords

# Contextual header for semantic understanding
contextual_header: |
  This context module provides [technique category] techniques for [specific purpose] 
  in the domain of [domain/application area]. It specifically addresses [primary problems] 
  by implementing [core methodology/approach]. This technique is most effective when 
  [optimal conditions] and works best in combination with [complementary techniques]. 
  It helps solve [specific problems] and produces [expected outcomes/benefits].

# Structured metadata for intelligent processing
embedding_metadata:
  domain: "domain-name"                              # Primary domain (prompt-engineering, code-generation, etc.)
  technique_type: "type-category"                    # See taxonomy below
  complexity_level: "beginner|intermediate|advanced" # User skill requirement
  
  # Functional characteristics
  primary_use_cases:
    - "specific-use-case-1"                          # Concrete, actionable scenarios
    - "specific-use-case-2"
    - "specific-use-case-3"
  
  solves_problems:
    - "specific-problem-1"                           # Clear problem statements
    - "specific-problem-2"
    - "specific-problem-3"
  
  # Relationship mapping
  works_well_with: ["technique-id-1", "technique-id-2"] # Synergistic combinations
  requires_techniques: ["prerequisite-id-1"]            # Hard dependencies (optional)
  conflicts_with: ["incompatible-id-1"]                 # Mutually exclusive techniques (optional)
  
  # NOTE: Implementation characteristics (token_impact, time_to_implement, 
  # maintenance_overhead), effectiveness scoring, quality metrics, versioning,
  # and validation status have been excluded as they require domain expertise 
  # and empirical assessment that will be added in a future enhancement phase.

  specifications, validation patterns, and consistency enforcement mechanisms. 
  This technique is most effective when generating JSON, XML, or other structured 
  data for automated consumption and works best in combination with templates, 
  prefilling, and validation examples. It helps solve format drift, parsing 
  errors, and integration failures, producing predictable, machine-readable 
  outputs suitable for reliable automated processing.
