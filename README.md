# Context Hub

A standardized schema and repository for storing contextual knowledge across multiple topic domains, with intelligent selection patterns.

## Purpose

Context Hub proposes and demonstrates a universal approach to organizing contextual knowledge in a structured, topic-agnostic format. The goal is to establish consistent metadata schemas and intelligent selection patterns that can be applied across any domain - from prompt engineering to React development to data analysis.

## Core Concept

### Schema-First Approach
- **Universal Metadata**: Consistent frontmatter structure that works for any topic
- **Rich Semantic Context**: Detailed descriptions enabling intelligent context discovery
- **Relationship Mapping**: Explicit connections between related concepts
- **Intelligent Selection**: Logical patterns for choosing and combining contexts

### Topic-Agnostic Structure

## Universal Schema Design

### Standardized Metadata Structure
```yaml
---
id: "unique-identifier"
title: "Human-Readable Name"
description: "Brief explanation"
category: "domain-specific-category"
tags: ["searchable", "keywords"]

contextual_header: |
  Rich semantic description explaining what this context provides,
  in which domain it applies, what problems it addresses, when it's
  most effective, what it works well with, and what outcomes it produces.

embedding_metadata:
  domain: "topic-area"
  technique_type: "categorization-within-domain"
  complexity_level: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
  primary_use_cases: ["specific-scenarios"]
  solves_problems: ["specific-issues"]
  works_well_with: ["related-context-ids"]
  requires_techniques: ["prerequisite-context-ids"]
  conflicts_with: ["incompatible-context-ids"]
---
```

### Intelligent Selection Patterns

The schema enables logical context selection through:

**Relationship-Based Selection:**
```yaml
# Automatic dependency resolution
chain-of-thought:
  requires_techniques: ["prompt-engineering-best-practices"]
  works_well_with: ["xml-tags-structure", "multishot-examples"]

# Conflict prevention
rapid-response-optimization:
  conflicts_with: ["chain-of-thought", "extended-thinking"]
```

**Problem-Solution Matching:**
```yaml
# Direct problem targeting
User Problem: "AI responses are inconsistent"
â†’ Search: solves_problems containing "inconsistent"
â†’ Found: output-consistency, template-based-prompting
â†’ Recommend: [output-consistency, prefilling-responses, template-based-prompting]
```

**Pattern-Based Selection:**
```yaml
# Common selection patterns
Speed-First: [prompt-engineering-best-practices, clear-direct-prompting]
Accuracy-First: [reduce-hallucinations, chain-of-thought, multishot-examples]
Production-First: [template-based-prompting, output-consistency, prefilling-responses]
Creative-First: [system-prompts-roles, clear-direct-prompting, character-consistency]
```

## Demonstrated Implementation

### Domain 1: Prompt Engineering âœ… Complete

**Schema Applied to 15+ Contexts:**
- `prompt-engineering-best-practices` (foundational)
- `chain-of-thought` (reasoning)
- `xml-tags-structure` (structured)
- `output-consistency` (consistency)
- `system-prompts-roles` (creative)
- [and more...]

**Intelligent Selection System:**
- **Core Selector**: Diagnostic questions and selection matrices
- **Pattern Library**: Common combinations for typical scenarios
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Logical approaches for resolving issues

**Relationship Mapping:**
- Dependencies: `chain-of-thought` requires `prompt-engineering-best-practices`
- Synergies: `xml-tags-structure` + `chain-of-thought` + `multishot-examples`
- Conflicts: Creative techniques vs. rigid consistency controls

### Domain 2: React (Planned)
Potential contexts following the same schema:
- `react-component-basics` (foundational)
- `state-management-hooks` (state)
- `performance-optimization` (optimization)
- `component-composition` (structured)

### Domain 3: Data Analysis (Planned)
Following the same organizational principles:
- `data-cleaning-fundamentals` (foundational)
- `statistical-analysis-methods` (analysis)
- `visualization-best-practices` (presentation)
- `exploratory-data-analysis` (discovery)

## Selection Intelligence Examples

### Scenario-Based Selection

**Customer Support Bot:**
```yaml
Requirements: Consistent, helpful, brand-appropriate responses
Selection Logic:
1. Base: prompt-engineering-best-practices (always required)
2. Persona: system-prompts-roles (customer service character)
3. Structure: template-based-prompting (consistent responses)
4. Consistency: character-consistency (maintain brand voice)
```

**Research Analysis Tool:**
```yaml
Requirements: Accurate, step-by-step analysis with transparency
Selection Logic:
1. Base: prompt-engineering-best-practices
2. Reasoning: chain-of-thought (transparent thinking)
3. Accuracy: reduce-hallucinations (minimize errors)
4. Structure: xml-tags-structure (organized output)
```

**API Data Extraction:**
```yaml
Requirements: Reliable JSON output for automated processing
Selection Logic:
1. Base: prompt-engineering-best-practices
2. Format: prefilling-responses (guaranteed JSON)
3. Reliability: output-consistency (stable formatting)
4. Clarity: multishot-examples (format examples)
```

### Troubleshooting Patterns

**Issue: Inconsistent outputs**
```yaml
Diagnosis: Consistency problem
Solution Path:
1. Add: output-consistency (format control)
2. Consider: template-based-prompting (structure)
3. Check: prefilling-responses (format enforcement)
```

**Issue: Poor reasoning quality**
```yaml
Diagnosis: Reasoning problem
Solution Path:
1. Add: chain-of-thought (step-by-step thinking)
2. Support: xml-tags-structure (organize reasoning)
3. Enhance: multishot-examples (show good reasoning)
```
